# MEMENTO Case

A laser cut front and back cover for the [Adafruit MEMENTO - Python Programmable DIY Camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5420) development board.  Case includes mounting points for an LED ring, a STEMMA QT breakout, and a 1/4 inch tripod post.  My first try at designing a laser cut project!  Inspired by the [Adafruit MEMENTO Camera Enclosure Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5843) which features an RGBW LED ring built into the front plate and a nice silkscreen on all four faces.  ![assembled case on tripod](tripod_front1.jpg)
